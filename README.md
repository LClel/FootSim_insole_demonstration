# FootSim_insole_demonstration
## Code and data used to simulate tactile responses to steps in "Modelling foot sole cutaneous afferents (FootSim)" (Katic et al. (2023), iScience, 105874-105874)

The code used within this mini-repository builds upon that in FootSim (https://github.com/ActiveTouchLab/footsim-python) to simulate tactile responses to walking

The data used within this simulations is part of a larger project, titled "Complexity of spatiotemporal plantar pressure patterns during everyday behaviours" (Cleland et al., in prep.). Further data and code related to this project can be found at https://github.com/LClel/project_insole. To generate the files in `preprocessed_data`, the pipeline run within https://github.com/LClel/project_insole will need to be run.

### This repository contains:
* `/data` - raw data files
* `/processed_data` - processed data that can be loaded in to generate only the figures
* `/code` - the code used to generate figures
* `/figures` - figures generated using the code
